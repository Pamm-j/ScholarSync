Certainly. If Tereisa is cc'd on the email, it would be wise to craft the message in a more inclusive manner, ensuring that it's constructive and doesn't feel like you're talking about her without addressing her. Here's a revised version with Tereisa in mind:

Dear Ms. Moseby and Tereisa,

I trust this message finds you both well. I'm writing to address the challenges and potential I see in our Algebra 2 class.

Tereisa, your ability to grasp the subject matter when you focus is evident. I genuinely believe in your potential and have put forth various measures to support you in reaching your academic goals. However, there seem to be some obstacles affecting your current performance, leading to a grade of 1% F in Algebra 2. 

For clarity and collaboration, I'm outlining these challenges and the support provided:

- **1:1 Support**: 
  - **Offered**: Daily individualized guidance and support.
  - **Response**: There have been instances where distractions, like phone usage or chats with peers, have taken precedence.
  
- **Phone Usage During Class**:
  - **Suggestion**: To put away the phone to concentrate better.
  - **Observation**: Continuous engagement with the phone during lessons, which might be affecting note-taking and classwork.
  
- **Seating Arrangement**:
  - **Offered**: A designated front-row seat to encourage focus.
  - **Choice**: Preference for another seat, often leading to non-academic conversations.
  
- **Opportunities for Grade Improvement**:
  - **Offered**: Chances to make up for missed quizzes and assignments for full credit.
  - **Current Status**: Two missed quizzes this grading period and several incomplete assignments.

Tereisa, I bring up these points not to criticize but to work together in finding the best way forward, especially with an essential test coming up.

Ms. Moseby, given your position and expertise, I believe your guidance will be invaluable in this situation. I'm hopeful that collectively, we can find strategies to better support Tereisa's academic journey.

Thank you for taking the time to address this. I am optimistic about our collaboration for a positive outcome.

Warm regards,

Ms. Pamela Tenney
Algebra 2 Teacher
